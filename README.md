Module 5

You will find the Pymaceuticals_Starter note book in Starter Code 8 >> Pymaceuticals

In this notebook- all of the code ran. However, there are a few places that may not be correct:
  - number of mice in data frame display
  - max timepoint for each mouse ID
  - treatment loop list.

Despite these potential errors- I do still believe my analysis will hold true (fingers crossed!)
